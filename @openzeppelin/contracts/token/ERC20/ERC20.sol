## ERC20

_Implementation of the {IERC20} interface.

This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
For a generic mechanism see {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
to implement supply mechanisms].

We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
instead returning &#x60;false&#x60; on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
applications.

Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
these events, as it isn&#x27;t required by the specification.

Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
allowances. See {IERC20-approve}._

### _balances

```solidity
mapping(address &#x3D;&gt; uint256) _balances
```

### _allowances

```solidity
mapping(address &#x3D;&gt; mapping(address &#x3D;&gt; uint256)) _allowances
```

### _totalSupply

```solidity
uint256 _totalSupply
```

### _name

```solidity
string _name
```

### _symbol

```solidity
string _symbol
```

### constructor

```solidity
constructor(string name_, string symbol_) public
```

_Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.

The default value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for
{decimals} you should overload it.

All two of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during
construction._

### name

```solidity
function name() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the name of the token._

### symbol

```solidity
function symbol() public view virtual returns (string)
```

_Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the
name._

### decimals

```solidity
function decimals() public view virtual returns (uint8)
```

_Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.
For example, if &#x60;decimals&#x60; equals &#x60;2&#x60;, a balance of &#x60;505&#x60; tokens should
be displayed to a user as &#x60;5.05&#x60; (&#x60;505 / 10 ** 2&#x60;).

Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between
Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is
overridden;

NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in
no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including
{IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}._

### totalSupply

```solidity
function totalSupply() public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-totalSupply}._

### balanceOf

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-balanceOf}._

### transfer

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transfer}.

Requirements:

- &#x60;to&#x60; cannot be the zero address.
- the caller must have a balance of at least &#x60;amount&#x60;._

### allowance

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) public view virtual returns (uint256)
```

_See {IERC20-allowance}._

### approve

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-approve}.

NOTE: If &#x60;amount&#x60; is the maximum &#x60;uint256&#x60;, the allowance is not updated on
&#x60;transferFrom&#x60;. This is semantically equivalent to an infinite approval.

Requirements:

- &#x60;spender&#x60; cannot be the zero address._

### transferFrom

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_See {IERC20-transferFrom}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not
required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.

NOTE: Does not update the allowance if the current allowance
is the maximum &#x60;uint256&#x60;.

Requirements:

- &#x60;from&#x60; and &#x60;to&#x60; cannot be the zero address.
- &#x60;from&#x60; must have a balance of at least &#x60;amount&#x60;.
- the caller must have allowance for &#x60;&#x60;from&#x60;&#x60;&#x27;s tokens of at least
&#x60;amount&#x60;._

### increaseAllowance

```solidity
function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_Atomically increases the allowance granted to &#x60;spender&#x60; by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- &#x60;spender&#x60; cannot be the zero address._

### decreaseAllowance

```solidity
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool)
```

_Atomically decreases the allowance granted to &#x60;spender&#x60; by the caller.

This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for
problems described in {IERC20-approve}.

Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.

Requirements:

- &#x60;spender&#x60; cannot be the zero address.
- &#x60;spender&#x60; must have allowance for the caller of at least
&#x60;subtractedValue&#x60;._

### _transfer

```solidity
function _transfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Moves &#x60;amount&#x60; of tokens from &#x60;sender&#x60; to &#x60;recipient&#x60;.

This internal function is equivalent to {transfer}, and can be used to
e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.

Emits a {Transfer} event.

Requirements:

- &#x60;from&#x60; cannot be the zero address.
- &#x60;to&#x60; cannot be the zero address.

the total supply.

Emits a {Transfer} event with &#x60;from&#x60; set to the zero address.

Requirements:

- &#x60;account&#x60; cannot be the zero address._

### _burn

```solidity
function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Destroys &#x60;amount&#x60; tokens from &#x60;account&#x60;, reducing the
total supply.

Emits a {Transfer} event with &#x60;to&#x60; set to the zero address.

Requirements:

- &#x60;account&#x60; cannot be the zero address.

```

_Sets &#x60;amount&#x60; as the allowance of &#x60;spender&#x60; over the &#x60;owner&#x60; s tokens.

This internal function is equivalent to &#x60;approve&#x60;, and can be used to

Does not update the allowance amount in case of infinite allowance.
Revert if not enough allowance is available.

Might emit an {Approval} event._

### _beforeTokenTransfer

```solidity
function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 amount) internal virtual
```

_Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes
minting and burning.

Calling conditions:

- when &#x60;from&#x60; and &#x60;to&#x60; are both non-zero, &#x60;amount&#x60; of &#x60;&#x60;from&#x60;&#x60;&#x27;s tokens
